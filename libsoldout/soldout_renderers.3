.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn lus_attr_escape
and
.Fn lus_body_escape
functions escape all problematic characters in (X)HTML:
.Ql < ,
.Ql > ,
.Ql & ,
.Ql \(dq ;
and
.Ql < ,
.Ql > ,
.Ql &
respectively.
They accept a string
.Va str
of the length
.Va len
and output into
.Va ob
buffer.
.Pp
All provided renderers come with two flavors,
.Va _html
producing HTML code (self-closing tags are rendered like this: <hr>),
and
.Va _xhtml
producing XHTML code (self-closing tags like <hr />).
.Pp
.Va mkd_html
and
.Va mkd_xhtml
implement standard markdown to (X)HTML translation without any extension.
.Pp
.Va discount_html
and
.Va discount_xhtml
implement on top of the standard markdown some of the extensions
found in Discount and PHP-Markdown-like tables.
Here is a list of all extensions included in these renderers:

.El

class blocks: blockquotes beginning with %class% will be rendered
as a div of the given class(es)
.El
.Pp
.Va nat_html
and

.Bl -bullet -width 1m
.It
id attribute for headers, using the syntax id#Header text
.It
class attribute for paragraphs, by putting class name(s)
between parenthesis at the very beginning of the paragraph

<ins> and <del> spans, using respectively ++ and -- as delimiters (with
emphasis-like restrictions, i.e. an opening delimiter cannot be followed by a
whitespace, and a closing delimiter cannot be preceded by a whitespace)
.It
plain <span> without attribute, using emphasis-like delimiter |
