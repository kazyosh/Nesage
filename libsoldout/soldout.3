.Sh NAME
.Nm soldout
.Nd markdown parser library
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library only performs the parsing of markdown input, the construction of
the output is left to a renderer, which is a set of callback functions
called when markdown elements are encountered.
Pointers to these functions are gathered into a
.Vt "struct mkd_renderer"
along with some renderer-related data.
.Pp
Basic usage will be:
.Bl -enum
.It
Create output, input buffers by
.Fn bufnew
function.
.It
Fill input buffer by
.Fn bufput
function.
.It
Create
.Vt "struct mkd_renderer"
or use provided renderer.
.It
Call
.Fn markdown
function.
.It
Process output buffer.
.It
Call
.Fn bufrelease
function to clean up buffers.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Simple example that uses first argument as a markdown string,
converts it to an HTML and outputs it to stdout.
.Bd -literal
#include <stdio.h>

#include <buffer.h>
#include <markdown.h>
#include <renderers.h>

#define INPUT_UNIT  1024
#define OUTPUT_UNIT 64

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  struct buf *ib, *ob;

  /* Make sure we have enough arguments. */
  if (argc != 2) {
    return 1;
  }

  ib = bufnew(INPUT_UNIT);
  ob = bufnew(OUTPUT_UNIT);

  /* bufputs() is a wrapper over bufput() for NUL-terminated string. */
  bufputs(ib, argv[1]);

  markdown(ob, ib, &mkd_html);

  /* Note the resulted data is not NUL-terminated string;
   * to make it use bufnullterm(). */
  printf("%.*s", (int)ob->size, ob->data);

  bufrelease(ib);
  bufrelease(ob);
  return 0;
